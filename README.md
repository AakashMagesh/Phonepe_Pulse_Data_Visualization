Overview
The Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal of this project is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. This README provides an overview of the project, its approach, and how to set it up.

Solution
The solution for this project involves several key steps:

Data Extraction: Clone the GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

Data Transformation: Use Python and libraries like Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

Database Insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

Dashboard Creation: Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. Utilize Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display the data on a map and provide multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Data Retrieval: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

Deployment: Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.
